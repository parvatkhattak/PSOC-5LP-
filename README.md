# PSoC 5LP Microcontroller Exploration for Two-Motor Drone Project

This repository contains the codes and circuit designs developed during my summer internship. The primary focus was to explore the PSoC 5LP microcontroller from Cypress Semiconductor using PSoC Creator 4.4, with the goal of building and understanding a two-motor drone.

## Overview

### Project Objectives
- **Understanding Microcontroller Basics:** Learning about LEDs, flip-flops, counters, and other fundamental components.
- **Analog/Digital Conversion:** Implementing ADC to read sensor data.
- **Communication Protocols:** Exploring I2C and UART for peripheral communication.
- **Sensor Integration:** Interfacing with various sensors including GPS, LiDAR, IMU, potentiometer, and more.
- **Motor Control:** Developing control mechanisms for BLDC and servo motors.
- **Additional Features:** Working with components like buzzers to add extra functionality.
